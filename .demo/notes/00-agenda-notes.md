📅 Speaker Notes: Session Agenda
"Welcome everyone! for 'Reverse Engineering SPFx Testing.' Let's take a look at the journey we're going to take."

### The Challenge: Testing SPFx
- 👉 "We'll start by grounding ourselves in why we need Vitest in the SPFx world. We'll do a quick recap of Vitest's powerful features and speed advantages."
- "This sets the stage for solving a common problem: reliable testing in a sometimes-tricky framework like SharePoint Framework."

### Reverse Engineering: Understanding the Manual Configuration
- "To truly master automation, we must first understand the process. We're going to reverse-engineer the Vitest setup manual setup."
- 👉 More broadly, the core philosophy here is that we can always apply this 'reverse engineering' mindset to deconstruct and automate any manual or complex development problem we face."


### [Live Demo] The Manual Process
- 👉"Then, we jump into our first live demo! I'll walk you through setting up the necessary files: package.json, tsconfig.json, and vitest.config.ts."
- 👉"Pay close attention here, as this is the knowledge base we use for the next step."

### Applying Reverse Engineering to AI: Automating with GitHub Copilot
- "Now for the fun part! We take that understanding from the manual setup and apply it to AI acceleration."
👉 "I'll show you how we reverse-engineer the prompt—taking the required configuration steps and structuring them into a single, comprehensive instruction set for Copilot to apply in your project."

### [Live Demo] The Automation
👉 "This will be our second demo and the peak of the session! You'll see how a single, well-crafted Copilot prompt can instantly generate and configure all those files we just created manually."
👉 "This transforms the setup process from minutes of manual work into seconds of GitHub Copilot."

### Key Takeaways & Q&A
- 👉"Finally, we'll wrap up with the main lessons learned:
- 👉 how to combine your expert SPFx knowledge with powerful AI tools to seriously speed up your workflow.
