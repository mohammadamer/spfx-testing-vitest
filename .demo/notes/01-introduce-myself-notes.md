Hello everyone! I'm delighted to be here.
It's an honor to be here in CollabDays greece and between all the awesome speakers in the event
Special thanks to Chris Spanougakis and the organizing team for making this event possible and for inviting me to be part of it! 🙏

I'm a Microsoft MVP in M365 Development and an experienced .NET & Azure Solution developer. 

I've focused on leveraging the Microsoft ecosystem—specifically Azure and Microsoft 365—to design and deliver business solutions on top of M365. 

My work main focus is on driving enterprise collaboration and building modern, cloud-first architectures using plateforms like SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, and SPFx.

I'm passionate about the community and sharing practical expertise, and I look forward to diving into today's topic with you.
