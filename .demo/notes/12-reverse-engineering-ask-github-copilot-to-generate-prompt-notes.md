## 🤖 GitHub Copilot Prompt - Vitest unit testing configuration prompt
I need to configure **Vitest** for a new **SharePoint Framework (SPFx)** project to enable unit testing. The goal is to set up Vitest unit testing

Please generate the following required changes for my SPFx solution in a markdown file

1.  **package.json update:** List all necessary development dependencies (e.g., `vitest`, testing utilities, environment setup) that need to be added.
2.  **tsconfig.json update:** Generate the necessary additions to the `types` array and configuration to ensure proper TypeScript support and intellisense with Vitest.
3.  **vitest.config.ts file:** Generate the complete content for the new `vitest.config.ts` file, ensuring it handles common SPFx project requirements (e.g., environment, test paths, dependency management).
4.  **tests/SetupTests.ts file:** Generate the complete content for the new `tests/SetupTests.ts` file, configured for global testing setup in the SPFx environment.
